# Getting Started

OnchainKit is your go-to SDK for building beautiful onchain applications.

Anyone can build an onchain app in 15 minutes with OnchainKit.

## Why OnchainKit?

OnchainKit streamlines onchain development by providing a comprehensive toolkit that combines powerful features with developer-friendly design:

- **Ergonomic design:** Our full-stack kits simplify complex onchain interactions into intuitive components and APIs that work seamlessly together.
- **Battle-tested patterns:** We've distilled industry best practices into opinionated tools and patterns, eliminating decision fatigue and helping you ship faster.
- **Purpose-built components:** From wallet integration to token swaps, our pre-built components handle common onchain workflows out of the box, letting you focus on your unique application logic.
- **Framework agnostic:** OnchainKit is framework agnostic, meaning it can be used with any framework that supports React.

We recommend starting a new OnchainKit app using `create onchain`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash
npm create onchain@latest
```

After the prompts, `create onchain` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.
