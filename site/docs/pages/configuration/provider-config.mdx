### Chain

`chain` is required for all OnchainKit components, as this specifies which chains
your OnchainKit project will interact with.

We recommend importing chains from wagmi or viem.

### Config

`config` is an object that can be used to customize the appearance and behavior
of the OnchainKit components.

This prop has two keys: `appearance` and `paymaster`.

#### Appearance

`appearance` manages the appearance of the OnchainKit components and has the following properties:

- `name` — The name of your OnchainKit project
- `logo` — The URL of the logo for your OnchainKit project
- `mode` — The mode of the OnchainKit components. Can be `auto`, `dark`, or `light`.
- `theme` — The theme of the OnchainKit components. Can be `base`, `cyberpunk`, `default`, `hacker`, or a custom theme.

Explore appearance options in the [OnchainKit Playground](https://onchainkit.xyz/playground).

#### Paymaster

`paymaster` represents the Paymaster URL that enables you to sponsor gas for your users.

### RPC URL

`rpcUrl` is required for any onchain requests. OnchainKit defaults to using
the [Coinbase Developer Platform Node](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/node) if `apiKey` is set, but you can provide your
own RPC URL if you would like.

### Project ID

`projectId` is required for the `<FundButton />` component.

You can obtain a Project ID from the [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects).

### Schema ID

`schemaId` is used to specify the schema ID for attestations from the Ethereum
Attestation Service (EAS).

This prop is optional, OnchainKit will default to using Coinbase attestations
for the `<Badge />` component if this prop is not provided.

If you would like to display other attestations, you can provide your own
`schemaId`, which you can obtain from the Etehreum Attestation Service (EAS).
