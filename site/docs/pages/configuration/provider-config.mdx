# OnchainKitProvider Configuration

`OnchainKitProvider` is a wrapper around OnchainKit that provides context to the
components. This provider exposes several configuration options that can be used
to customize the behavior of your application.

### Address

\*\*\*\*\*WHAT IS THIS?????\*\*\*\*\*

### `apiKey`

`apiKey` is Required for `<Swap />`, \*\*\*\*\*WHAT ELSE?????????\*\*\*\*\*

You can obtain an API Key from the Coinbase Developer Platform.

### Chain

`chain` is required for all OnchainKit components, as this specifies which chains
your OnchainKit project will interact with.

We recommend importing chains from wagmi or viem.

### Config

`config` is an object that can be used to customize the appearance and behavior
of the OnchainKit components.

This prop has two keys:

- `appearance` manages the appearance of the OnchainKit components and has the following properties:
  - `name` — The name of your OnchainKit project
  - `logo` — The URL of the logo for your OnchainKit project
  - `mode` — The mode of the OnchainKit components. Can be `auto`, `dark`, or `light`.
  - `theme` — The theme of the OnchainKit components. Can be `base`, `cyberpunk`, `default`, `hacker`, or a custom theme.
- `paymaster` represents the Paymaster URL if you use a paymaster to sponsor gas for your users.

### RPC URL

`rpcUrl` is required for any onchain requests. OnchainKit defaults to using
the Coinbase Developer Platform Node if `apiKey` is set, but you can provide your
own RPC URL if you would like.

### Project ID

`projectId` is required for the `<FundButton />` component.

You can obtain a Project ID from the Coinbase Developer Platform.

### Schema ID

OnchainKit defaults to using Coinbase attestations for the `<Badge />` component.

If you would like to display other attestations, you can provide your own
`schemaId`, which you can obtain from the Etehreum Attestation Service (EAS).
