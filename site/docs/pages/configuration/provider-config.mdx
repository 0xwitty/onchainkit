### `apiKey`

`apiKey` is your Coinbase Developer Platform Client API Key.

This prop is required for certain OnchainKit components, including:

- Checkout
- NFTCard
- NFTMintCard
- Swap
- Token
- Transaction (???? talk to alissa)

You can get a [Client API Key](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/project-id/api-keys/client-key)
from Coinbase Developer Platform.

### Chain

`chain` specifies which chains your OnchainKit project will interact with.

This prop is required for all OnchainKit components.

We recommend importing chain data from [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/chains)
or [viem](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction).

### Config

`config` is an object that can be used to customize the appearance and behavior
of the OnchainKit components.

This prop has two keys: `appearance` and `paymaster`.

#### Appearance

`appearance` manages the appearance of the OnchainKit components and has the following properties:

- `name` — The name of your OnchainKit project
- `logo` — The URL of the logo for your OnchainKit project
- `mode` — The mode of the OnchainKit components. Can be `auto`, `dark`, or `light`.
- `theme` — The theme of the OnchainKit components. Can be `base`, `cyberpunk`, `default`, `hacker`, or a custom theme.

Explore appearance options in the [OnchainKit Playground](https://onchainkit.xyz/playground).

#### Paymaster

`paymaster` represents the Paymaster URL that enables you to sponsor gas for your users.

You can configure your Paymaster and obtain your Paymaster URL from the
[Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/bundler-and-paymaster).

### RPC URL

`rpcUrl` is required for any onchain requests. If you provide your own RPC URL,
OnchainKit will use it.

If you do not provide your own RPC URL, you must provide an `apiKey`, which
enables OnchainKit to use the
[Coinbase Developer Platform Node](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/node).

### Project ID

`projectId` is your Coinbase Developer Platform Project ID.

This prop is required for the `<FundButton />` component.

You can obtain a Project ID from the [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects).

### Address _[Deprecation Pending]_

`address` is no longer used and will be removed in a future version of
OnchainKit.

### Schema ID _[Deprecation Pending]_

`schemaId` is no longer used as OnchainKit now defaults to using Coinbase
attestations for the `<Badge />` component.

This prop will be removed in a future version of OnchainKit.
